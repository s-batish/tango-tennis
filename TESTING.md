### Responsiveness
- The website has been tested on Chrome, Edge and Firefox as well as on an iPhone 11, iPhone 13 mini, Samsung Galaxy S22, and iPad 6th Generation in order to check the responsiveness on different devices and different browsers.
- The responsiveness of each page of the website has also been tested using Chrome Developer tools to ensure that the website maintains a clear display across all screen sizes from 320px upwards.
### Browser Compatability
- The website has been tested on Chrome, Firefox and Edge to ensure that it functions on a range of browsers.
### Accessiblity
- The website has been passed through [WAVE](https://wave.webaim.org/) to check the accessibility of the site.
- Originally there were errors to do with the contrast on the Our Classes page and on all the forms due to the light grey font colour being challenging to read on the light teal background. This was amended by changing the font colour to black which removed these errors.
- There were alerts mentioned on all of the pages about a redundant link but this is because in the header the logo and the Home button both take the user back to the Home page.
- There were also errors on the Our Classes page due to their being 3 empty table headers, however, after adding aria-labels to these cells, the errors were resolved.

### Unit Tests
- Unit tests were carried out to check the basic functionality of the home, lessons, and bookings views.
- These tests check that the correct templates are rendered and also tests some redirects.
- To perform these tests enter the following command into the terminal:
    - python3 manage.py test --settings=tangotennis.settings_test
- The results can be seen below:

![Unit test results](docs/testing/unittests.png)
### Code Validation
#### HTML
- All pages were passed through the [W3C HTML Validator](https://validator.w3.org/) and any errors that were found were corrected so none of the pages are showing any warnings or errors.
- Because of Django's templating language, the files could not be copied and pasted into the validator. Instead, the code validation was checked by right clicking on the page, viewing the page source and copying this into the validator.
#### CSS
- The site was passed through the [W3C CSS Validator](https://jigsaw.w3.org/css-validator/) and no errors were found.

![CSS validator results](docs/testing/css-validator.png)
#### JavaScript
- JavaScript code was passed through [JSHint](https://jshint.com/) and the only issue it raised was that in the base.html file bootstrap was an undefined variable. As the JavaScript here was actually referring to Bootstrap Alerts, and I was assigning a new Bootstrap alert to the existing alert, I thought I could ignore this warning.

![JS validator results](docs/testing/js-validator.png)

- The other piece of JavaScript in this project was in the our_classes.html file, and the only issues that came up were missing semicolons, which I amended.

#### Python
- All python files were passed through the [CI Python Linter](https://pep8ci.herokuapp.com/#). 
- The main error that was reported was that there was no new line at the end of one of the files but this was quickly amended.
- The only remaining file with some lines that are too long is the settings.py file due to the AUTH_PASSWORD_VALIDATORS being too long.
### Bugs
#### Solved Bugs
- I had an incorrect file path for the add_lessons.html file as I was receiving the error that the template did not exist.
    - Solution: I had to add the add_lessons.html file to a lessons folder within the templates folder in the lessons app.
- I had an incorrect success url for adding a lesson which was leading to a 404 error.
    - Solution: I had to correct the url from /our_classes to /lessons/our_classes.
- When adding lessons to the timetable, the days were appearing in alphabetical order instead of in order of the days of the week.
    - Solution: I edited the lessons model to make the DAY choice fields integers from 1-7 so that they would be ordered correctly on the timetable.
    - I then tried migrating the new model but ran into a new error that it could not migrate correctly, so I had to delete all the migration files and reset the database on ElephantSQL.
    After doing this and resetting the superuser, everything worked as intended.
- I was getting a type error when a non-signed in user adds /bookings/manage_bookings/ or /my_reviews to the home page url.
    - Solution: I had to add the LoginRequiredMixin to the BookingsList and MyReviews view.py files so that only logged in users can reach those pages and non-signed in users are redirected to the login page.
- I had an issue where any signed in users could add lessons to the Create Lessons page if they inputted /lessons/add_lessons to the home page url.
    - Solution: I added the UserPassesTestMixin to the AddLessons view so that only staff members can access this page other users would be shown the 403 page.
#### Unsolved Bugs
- On the Our Classes page there is a horizontal scroll on mobile devices. I attempted to solve this by following what I had read [here](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/14360581/force-landscape-orientation-mode#:~:text=lock('landscape')%3B,and%20stay%20in%20landscape%20mode) on Stack Overflow. I added the class timetable to the Our Classes table-responsive div and then added the following code to my css file: 
```
@media screen and (min-width: 280px) and (max-width: 470px) and (orientation: portrait) {
    .timetable {
      transform: rotate(-90deg);
      transform-origin: left top;
      width: 100vh;
      height: 100vw;
      overflow-x: hidden;
      position: absolute;
      top: 100%;
      left: 0;
    }
  }
```
This did rotate the Our Classes timetable however, the header and footer were not rotated alongside this. To try and fix this I created a div at the top of the our_classes.html file and gave it the class of timetable instead and wrapped everything in the file inside this div. This did produce the desired outcome as can be seen below:

![Our Classes gif](docs/testing/our_classes_gif.gif)

However, when I checked the HTML of this page I received the following errors:
![Our Classes errors](docs/testing/our_classes_errors.png)
This was because of the timetable div wrapping the entire page and as I could not find a solution to this I decided to leave the Our Classes page as it originally was with the horizontal scroll.

- I originally created the home app to just render the home page index.html template, but I later decided to add the reviews functionality to my website. Because the reviews are rendered on the home page, I made the model, views and form for this within the home app as I initially thought this made sense as this was all to display on the same page. However, after a discussion with my mentor it was agreed that the reviews functionality should be contained within its own app so there should a separate home app and reviews app. Unfortunately, due to time constraints I was unable to separate the home app into two to have the reviews as its own app, but this is something I'd look to implement going forwards.
- As I have mentioned in the future features section, currently the add lessons functionality does not correlate to the booking form, meaning that if a staff member decides that there will only be one beginners class on a Monday, this will not be reflected in the booking form. This is something that I would really like to implement, but due to my current level of knowledge I was unable to do so at the moment. Therefore, to ensure that the booking form makes sense with regards to the lesson timetable, there are currently lessons everyday at all of the time slots.
